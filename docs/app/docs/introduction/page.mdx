# Introduction

**Kyle** is a fast, polyglot task runner for any project. Define tasks in a `Kylefile` and run them with `kyle <task>`.

## Why Kyle?

- **Polyglot** — Supports YAML and TOML out of the box, with more formats coming
- **Zero migration** — Works with existing Makefiles and Justfiles automatically
- **Namespaces** — Run tasks across subdirectories with `kyle backend:build`
- **Fast** — Written in Rust, starts instantly
- **Cross-platform** — Linux, macOS, and Windows

## Quick Example

```toml filename="Kylefile"
# kyle: toml
name = "my-project"

[tasks.build]
desc = "Build the project"
run = "cargo build --release"

[tasks.test]
desc = "Run tests"
run = "cargo test"
deps = ["build"]
```

```bash
kyle          # List available tasks
kyle build    # Run the build task
kyle test     # Runs build first, then test
```

## Zero Config

Kyle auto-detects existing project files. No migration needed:

```bash
# Have a Makefile? Just works.
kyle build    # runs make build

# Have a justfile? Just works.
kyle test     # runs just test
```

Kyle checks for files in this order:
1. `Kylefile` (YAML/TOML)
2. `Makefile`
3. `justfile`

If you add a `Kylefile`, it takes priority — your existing files stay untouched.
